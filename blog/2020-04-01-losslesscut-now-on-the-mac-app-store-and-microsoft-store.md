LosslessCut has become more and more popular recently, and I've gotten literally over a hundred of emails from people thanking me and saying LosslessCut is what they have been looking for for a long time. In these coronaüç∫times I've had lots of time to work on it and I have added a [lot of new features](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut#features) and improved the user interface.

Many people have requested LosslessCut to be [distributed through more channels](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/issues/218) to reach more people and ease installation and [auto updating](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/issues/5). Major operating systems also show a scary warning now, when trying to open an executable downloaded from the internet.

I decided to charge a small price for the apps distributed through the Microsoft and Apple stores, to cover the costs I'm paying for the Apple and Microsoft fees as well as the many hours I put into this very tiring work of dealing with release management. **LosslessCut binaries downloaded directly from GitHub will of course always be free and open source.** So if you want to support the work I do, you can either [donate](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut#donate-) or purchase the app from the stores. Using the store version has the benefit of auto updates and less hassle with *unverified executables* that Mac OS and Windows always complains about these days when downloading files from the internet.

I hope you like it and I will continue improving LosslessCut üôå
