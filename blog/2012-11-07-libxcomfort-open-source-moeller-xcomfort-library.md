[libxcomfort](https://github.com/mifi/libxcomfort) is an open source library for controlling Moeller / Eaton's xComfort devices through the `CKOZ-00/03` USB dongle. Currently `RS232` is not implemented, only the `USB` protocol. It can currently be used for:

- Getting/setting the dim value.
- Starting/stopping gradual up/down dimming
- Turning actuators/dimmers hard on/off.
- Some other commands like reporting temperatures/measurements have been partially reverse engineered but not implemented.
