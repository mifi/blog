Oslo city bike is a great system and I often jump on a bike. But sometimes I wanted to be able to quickly check the status of the bicycles in my neighbourhood from my computer without having to log in to the app on my phone. Oslobysykkel doesn't have this information in their map, so I made a public map with live updated availability of the bikes.

[Check it out ðŸš²](http://mifi.no/bysykkel/)

**Update**: I see that oslobysykkel.no just updated their map to include availability at the very same time ðŸ˜‚
