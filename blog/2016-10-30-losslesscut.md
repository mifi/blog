I needed a tool for quickly trimming recorded videos, so I built my first Electron app, check it out:

It is a cross platform simple video editor for lossless trimming / cutting of videos using ffmpeg and Electron. Great for rough processing of large video files taken from a video camera, drone, etc. Lets you quickly get rid of the useless parts. It doesn't do any decoding / encoding and is therefore very fast and has no quality loss. Also allows for taking JPEG snapshots of the video at the selected time.
