HTTP Live Streaming with on-the-fly encoding of any video file for Apple TV/iPhone/iPad/iPod and possibly other devices.

[hls-vod](https://github.com/mifi/hls-vod) lets you stream your whole video collection on-demand, regardless of format (as long as VLC can transcode it), to your iOS devices, playable from Safari, working AirPlay as well.

It is built on node.js.

Usage:
```
npm i -g hls-vod
hls-vod --root-path /path/to/my/videos

```
