Personal Hotspot disappeared from settings on iPhone when using a new SIM card? Googled for a solution but I didn't find one. Seems that the problem was that the APN for personal hotspot wasn't configured.

Go to `Settings` -> `Mobile Data` -> `Mobile Data Network`
Set the same settings underÂ section `Personal Hotspot` as section `Mobile Data`
