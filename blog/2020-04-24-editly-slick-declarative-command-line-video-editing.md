Editly is a tool and framework for declarative NLE (non-linear video editing) using Node.js and ffmpeg. It allows you to **easily and programmatically** create a video from set of clips, images and titles, with smooth transitions between.

There is a simple command line for quickly assembling a video from a set of clips or images, or you can use it from Javascript!
