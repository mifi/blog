I made an example GitHub Action workflow that will automatically push all files in a specified directory to a **different GitHub repo** using a [GitHub deploy key](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/developers/overview/managing-deploy-keys). By enabling GitHub Pages for the destination repo, you can **serve content dynamically generated by a GitHub action workflow/job.**

[Check it out!](https://github.com/mifi/github-action-push-static)

## Use cases

- Publish static (gatsby, jekyll etc.) site to separate GitHub repository
- Publish build results to a web endpoint
- Publish istanbul test coverage from unit/integration tests
- Publish a custom badge like [shields.io](https://shields.io) (e.g a test coverage badge) ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mifi/github-action-push-static/main/custom-badge/example.svg)

## Why?

- Free serving of public websites with git history (public repositories don't cost anything)
- Don't have to pay for services like `codecov.io` or `coveralls.io`
- Don't bloat your main repo with a long history of ever changing files.
- Don't risk exposing any personal github token from a github action (a leak which which could give someone access to your whole GitHub account).
