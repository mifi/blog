## Actually "Request Desktop Website"

It's a known fact that the "Request Desktop Site" function doesn't do much on iPhone. That's because it will just change the browser's user agent. However most websites do not care about the user agent these days, instead they implement responsive design which often cripples websites on mobile by simply hiding core functionaily. One example of such a website is Apple's own App Store Connect. So what's the solution? It turns out you *can* change the screen size on iPhone, by pressing the *reduce font size* button (small "A").
