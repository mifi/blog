## WeChat Pay / Weixin Pay / 微信支付

In the past it was very hard for tourists to pay for services in China, but recently China has opened up for foreigners to use the WeChat Pay service (which is used virtually everywhere). You can link a credit/debit card like Visa/MasterCard and then pay using it in China. Some reports that the card has to be added from outside China (not sure if VPN from China works)

### 200CNY no-fee limit

If you transfer 200CNY or less per transaction, the transaction will not incur any fees from WeChat. If not, a 3% fee is added to the amount. A common workaround to get a free payment above 200CNY is to ask the vendor to split the payment into <=200CNY transactions. This works, but note that when I transferred 3 payments of 200 to a Chinese person, the 4th transaction got rejected.
