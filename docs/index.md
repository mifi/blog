# Knowledge base

This is my personal knowledge base and reference for all kinds of subjects (but mostly technical stuff). Inspired by [@nikitavoloboev](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev)'s ["Everything I Know"](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/).

There is also the [blog](/blog/) which contains some articles too. I intend to move many of those over here.
