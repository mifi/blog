## Thermal cameras

Thermal (IR/infrared) cameras are hard to build and mass produce and therefore costly and usually with a low resolution.

### Seek Thermal

Resolution: 206x156.

I used to have a Seek Thermal, however they only support Lightning, and seem to not [work with USB-C](https://www.reddit.com/r/Thermal/comments/176zbot/seek_thermal_official_response_to_iphone_usbc/). So I sold it.

## [UNI-T UTi721M](https://thermal.uni-trend.com/product/uti721m/)

Resolution: 256x192.

"UTi721M Smartphone Thermal Camera Module for Android". UNI-T is a Chinese company making thermal cameras. I bought it from [Clas Ohlson](https://www.clasohlson.com/no/UNI-T-Uti21M-varmekamera-for-Android/p/36-9242). Seems like a great camera. Great resolution and app works well.
